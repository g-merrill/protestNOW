# protestNOW

For my final full-stack web application during GA's Software Engineering Immersive, protestNOW is an app that is designed for protestors.  This app is intended to bring people together under a common cause, yet aims to do so by allowing protesters to share their individual stories for why they chose to protest.  Most times, protests have  been powerful and effective group experiences. Yet for me, sometimes it has been difficult learning the personal and powerful reasons for why everyone else is out there with me.  Also, I wanted to create a way to extend the protest's message beyond the designated day.  protestNOW aims to be as shareable as possible to remedy the latter.  Share, search, filter, and customization functionality as well as improvements on the design/user experience for this app are in the works!
